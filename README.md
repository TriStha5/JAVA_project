## About Kaata Web
Kaata Web is a web-based software developed in Java programming language to store the details of a city. The main purpose of this project is to help the tourists and other visitors to the city by providing information about hotels, transportation facilities, air ticket booking, shopping details, city news, etc. Software will be developed using Spring Boot Framework and uses Database for storing data and information. Software has different features like searching, adding, deleting and editing as well.

With the help of Kaata Web, a tourist or any one new to the city can easily get the knowledge of the particular place. It helps people to know about the hotels around that area, hospital near them, historical places to visit, school near them and many more which makes them search this very easily and quickly. Kaata Web can improve our lifestyle by making the newcomer explore the city without any external help like brokers or other different organizations.
